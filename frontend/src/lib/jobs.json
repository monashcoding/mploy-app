Ability to meet top executives across the industry. A role where you can give back, and have a positive impact on the Australian financial system. A rotational program where you can influence your journey. Develop yourself both technically and personally, in a culture that cares.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>The not-so-good bits:&nbsp;</strong>We need to be mindful being Government, and reputational risk, so there are a number of meetings before we finalise our work. Potentially not as many ‘perks' as private sector roles.<br />\r\n<strong>Hiring grads with degrees:&nbsp;</strong> Commerce, Actuarial, Engineering, Mathematics, STEM, IT &amp; Computer Sciences;&nbsp;Finance, Accounting, Economics &amp; Business Administration;&nbsp;Humanities, Arts &amp; Social Sciences;&nbsp;Law &amp; Legal Studies&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The APRA Graduate Program is one of the most in-depth and diverse in the financial services industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Graduate Program runs for 15 months. During this time you will complete three five-month rotations across a number of our teams including frontline supervision, risk, policy and advice, or data analytics. This program gives you the opportunity to build the core foundations of prudential regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside these rotations, you will be supported by an in-depth learning and development program, including access to an extensive range of in-house training programs. These are designed to support you to grow your technical and personal capabilities and help jump-start your career as a financial professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional development is ongoing throughout your career with us. In fact, professional development is an integral part of ensuring we maintain our excellence as a regulator. As one of our graduates, you’ll benefit from:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Being assigned a buddy - who is a graduate from the year before, and is fresh with understanding the challenges of being a graduate at APRA.</li>\r\n\t<li>Support from&nbsp;a number of managers – who manage you on each of your rotations, as well as a manager to support you&nbsp;for the duration of the Graduate Program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Working as part of an APRA team from the start.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of your Graduate Program, you will remain an employee of APRA and have the opportunity to drive your career in any of APRA's core functions, including specialist areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduate placements will be available in our Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch a series of videos featuring past graduates who share their experience being involved in the APRA Graduate Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Australian Prudential Regulation story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the privatisation and deregulation binge of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Federal Government established the Financial System Inquiry in 1996. It was tasked with proposing a regulatory system that would ensure an “efficient, responsive, competitive and flexible financial system to underpin stronger economic performance, consistent with financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness”. (Previously Australia’s financial services industry was regulated by the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Reserve Bank.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Financial System Inquiry recommended a statutory authority of the Federal Government be set up to oversee banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies, insurance companies and the superannuation industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 1 1998, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (commonly referred to as APRA) was established to do exactly this. Ever since, it has supervised institutions holding assets for Australian bank customers, insurance policyholders and super fund members. With considerable success across two decades, APRA has ensured those entities that make up the financial services industry remain financially sound and able to meet their obligations to their clients. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our vision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to reflect APRA's forward-looking philosophy, our Vision is focused on two strategic themes: Protected today and prepared for tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our values</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our values&nbsp;underpin the critical role we play in protecting the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our values were selected to help everyone at APRA to achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. In our work and in our interactions with others, we seek to demonstrate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;– we act without bias, are balanced in the use of our powers, and deliver on our commitments.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>&nbsp;– we actively seek out and encourage diverse points of view, to produce well-founded decisions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Accountability</strong>&nbsp;– we are open to challenge and scrutiny, and take responsibility for our actions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Respect</strong>&nbsp;– we are always respectful of others, and their opinions and ideas</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Excellence</strong>&nbsp;– we maintain high standards of quality and professionalism in all that we do</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Working and acting in these ways helps us achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our supervisory approach is forward-looking, primarily risk-based, consultative, consistent and in line with international best practices. This approach also recognises that management and boards of supervised institutions are primarily responsible for financial soundness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The culture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s workplace diversity strategy “takes a pro-active and innovative approach in creating a flexible and inclusive employment environment that values and utilises the contribution of people of different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and abilities”.&nbsp;APRA offers an extensive range of flexible work arrangements to allow staff to meet family and other commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social contribution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA staff play a vital role in protecting the financial well-being of almost every Australian citizen by overseeing around $8 trillion of bank deposits, super contributions and insurance premiums. APRA also has a workplace-giving scheme that allows donations to be taken directly from an employee’s salary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The vibe of the place</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA combines most of the good aspects of the public and private sectors. Staff are well looked after but also get to enjoy a good work-life balance and an enviable degree of job security. While a clear hierarchy exists, those at the top of it are approachable. There are lots of social events and staff often go out for social occasions at the end of the working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The recruitment process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA recruits graduates who’ve achieved at least a minimum credit average in, but not limited to a discipline. Graduates from the following degrees are generally attracted to apply: actuarial studies, commerce, economics, econometrics, finance, financial modelling, law, mathematics, Engineering, public policy and statistics. Those from other disciplines may be considered if they are high achievers with impressive research and analytical skills. The grad program is currently only available at APRA’s Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications open: February - April Annually, and at times an additional recruitment round can be opened throughout the year. If you are interested to keep in contact, register your interest by clicking the pre-register button below</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Apply online (February - April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Psychometric assessment (April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Assessment Centre (3 hours) (May)</li>\r\n\t<li>Final interview (In person in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or virtually) (June)</li>\r\n\t<li>Reference check (June -July)</li>\r\n\t<li>Offer or Merit List (July onwards)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year we often see many fabulous graduates, more than we can offer. In this instance, we inform some applicants that they are on a ‘Merit’ list. APRA uses this list should APRA increase the graduate program intake number or a graduate withdraws from the program. We also look to the Merit list before opening up a new recruitment campaign and we will keep you updated for the next 6 months regarding graduate-level opportunities across APRA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remuneration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s funding is provided by the industry it regulates rather than the taxpayer, and it offers unusually lavish benefits for a public-sector employer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA's graduate starting salary is $85,000 inclusive of superannuation. APRA is focused on intensively building your capabilities, and through capability growth, on average, graduate salaries have increased 10% annually for the first few years of your career. APRA is dedicated to investing in early talent and reviews salaries comparatively with external and internal salary data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy a range of benefits including working in a flexible, inclusive and diverse environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some benefits offered to employees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Health and well-being checks</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual flu vaccinations</li>\r\n\t<li>Employee Assistance Program (professional and confidential counselling sessions for employees and their immediate families)</li>\r\n\t<li>Wellbeing Ambassador network</li>\r\n\t<li>Ergonomic workstations</li>\r\n\t<li>Regular social events</li>\r\n\t<li>Subsidised corporate team sports, running events and pedometer challenge</li>\r\n\t<li>Discounted gym memberships</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Career prospects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing the grad program, we will work with you to find a team that you wish to join permanently. In joining that team, you will be promoted to the role of Analyst. APRA promotes employees on capability growth, so your path and progression are your own, following the graduate program. &nbsp;You do not have to stay in a role level for a period of time before progression. APRA encourages open and honest discussions between the employee and their manager. We have numerous training courses to strengthen your skills, both personally and technically. APRA is focused on encouraging mobility; therefore you can move across teams as opportunities become available, or an opportunity to be seconded to another agency such as the RBA, ASIC, Treasury or the like.&nbsp;</p>",

That’s where you come in. Maintain the world’s confidence in capital markets and drive innovation. Just accounting and finance? It’s trust in numbers, clear in the complex and new ways in solid systems. That’s creating a better world and an exciting career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose your pathway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways. With a range of disciplines and specialties, you can start in one place and go almost anywhere as you build your career here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply to this Audit, Assurance, and Finance pathway and you’ll have the option to select the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and interests fit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location of this job:</strong> nominate your KPMG office location during the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is being a consultant?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company, a local charity, or a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be forensic accountants working alongside an environmental specialist and change and communications professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work itself is varied depending on your team and the client, so expect to build knowledge of several industries and businesses.

Ability to meet top executives across the industry. A role where you can give back, and have a positive impact on the Australian financial system. A rotational program where you can influence your journey. Develop yourself both technically and personally, in a culture that cares.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>The not-so-good bits:&nbsp;</strong>We need to be mindful being Government, and reputational risk, so there are a number of meetings before we finalise our work. Potentially not as many ‘perks' as private sector roles.<br />\r\n<strong>Hiring grads with degrees in:&nbsp;</strong>Commerce, Actuarial, Engineering, Mathematics, STEM, IT &amp; Computer Sciences;&nbsp;Finance, Accounting, Economics &amp; Business Administration;&nbsp;Humanities, Arts &amp; Social Sciences;&nbsp;Law &amp; Legal Studies&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The APRA Graduate Program is one of the most in-depth and diverse in the financial services industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Graduate Program runs for 15 months. During this time you will complete three five-month rotations across a number of our teams including frontline supervision, risk, policy and advice, or data analytics. This program gives you the opportunity to build the core foundations of prudential regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside these rotations, you will be supported by an in-depth learning and development program, including access to an extensive range of in-house training programs. These are designed to support you to grow your technical and personal capabilities and help jump-start your career as a financial professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional development is ongoing throughout your career with us. In fact, professional development is an integral part of ensuring we maintain our excellence as a regulator. As one of our graduates, you’ll benefit from:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Being assigned a buddy - who is a graduate from the year before, and is fresh with understanding the challenges of being a graduate at APRA.</li>\r\n\t<li>Support from&nbsp;a number of managers – who manage you on each of your rotations, as well as a manager to support you&nbsp;for the duration of the Graduate Program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Working as part of an APRA team from the start.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of your Graduate Program, you will remain an employee of APRA and have the opportunity to drive your career in any of APRA's core functions, including specialist areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduate placements will be available in our Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch a series of videos featuring past graduates who share their experience being involved in the APRA Graduate Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Australian Prudential Regulation story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the privatisation and deregulation binge of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Federal Government established the Financial System Inquiry in 1996. It was tasked with proposing a regulatory system that would ensure an “efficient, responsive, competitive and flexible financial system to underpin stronger economic performance, consistent with financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness”. (Previously Australia’s financial services industry was regulated by the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Reserve Bank.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Financial System Inquiry recommended a statutory authority of the Federal Government be set up to oversee banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies, insurance companies and the superannuation industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 1 1998, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (commonly referred to as APRA) was established to do exactly this. Ever since, it has supervised institutions holding assets for Australian bank customers, insurance policyholders and super fund members. With considerable success across two decades, APRA has ensured those entities that make up the financial services industry remain financially sound and able to meet their obligations to their clients. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our vision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to reflect APRA's forward-looking philosophy, our Vision is focused on two strategic themes: Protected today and prepared for tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our values</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our values&nbsp;underpin the critical role we play in protecting the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our values were selected to help everyone at APRA to achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. In our work and in our interactions with others, we seek to demonstrate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;– we act without bias, are balanced in the use of our powers, and deliver on our commitments.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>&nbsp;– we actively seek out and encourage diverse points of view, to produce well-founded decisions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Accountability</strong>&nbsp;– we are open to challenge and scrutiny, and take responsibility for our actions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Respect</strong>&nbsp;– we are always respectful of others, and their opinions and ideas</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Excellence</strong>&nbsp;– we maintain high standards of quality and professionalism in all that we do</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Working and acting in these ways helps us achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our supervisory approach is forward-looking, primarily risk-based, consultative, consistent and in line with international best practices. This approach also recognises that management and boards of supervised institutions are primarily responsible for financial soundness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The culture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s workplace diversity strategy “takes a pro-active and innovative approach in creating a flexible and inclusive employment environment that values and utilises the contribution of people of different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and abilities”.&nbsp;APRA offers an extensive range of flexible work arrangements to allow staff to meet family and other commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social contribution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA staff play a vital role in protecting the financial well-being of almost every Australian citizen by overseeing around $8 trillion of bank deposits, super contributions and insurance premiums. APRA also has a workplace-giving scheme that allows donations to be taken directly from an employee’s salary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The vibe of the place</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA combines most of the good aspects of the public and private sectors. Staff are well looked after but also get to enjoy a good work-life balance and an enviable degree of job security. While a clear hierarchy exists, those at the top of it are approachable. There are lots of social events and staff often go out for social occasions at the end of the working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The recruitment process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA recruits graduates who’ve achieved at least a minimum credit average in, but not limited to a discipline. Graduates from the following degrees are generally attracted to apply: actuarial studies, commerce, economics, econometrics, finance, financial modelling, law, mathematics, Engineering, public policy and statistics. Those from other disciplines may be considered if they are high achievers with impressive research and analytical skills. The grad program will be only available at APRA’s Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications open: February - April Annually, and at times an additional recruitment round can be opened throughout the year. If you are interested to keep in contact, register your interest by clicking the pre-register button below</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Apply online (February - April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Psychometric assessment (April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Assessment Centre (3 hours) (May)</li>\r\n\t<li>Final interview (In person in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or virtually) (June)</li>\r\n\t<li>Reference check (June -July)</li>\r\n\t<li>Offer or Merit List (July onwards)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year we often see many fabulous graduates, more than we can offer. In this instance, we inform some applicants that they are on a ‘Merit’ list. APRA uses this list should APRA increase the graduate program intake number or a graduate withdraws from the program. We also look to the Merit list before opening up a new recruitment campaign and we will keep you updated for the next 6 months regarding graduate-level opportunities across APRA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remuneration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s funding is provided by the industry it regulates rather than the taxpayer, and it offers unusually lavish benefits for a public-sector employer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA's graduate starting salary is $85,000 inclusive of superannuation. APRA is focused on intensively building your capabilities, and through capability growth, on average, graduate salaries have increased 10% annually for the first few years of your career. APRA is dedicated to investing in early talent and reviews salaries comparatively with external and internal salary data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy a range of benefits including working in a flexible, inclusive and diverse environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some benefits offered to employees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Health and well-being checks</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual flu vaccinations</li>\r\n\t<li>Employee Assistance Program (professional and confidential counselling sessions for employees and their immediate families)</li>\r\n\t<li>Wellbeing Ambassador network</li>\r\n\t<li>Ergonomic workstations</li>\r\n\t<li>Regular social events</li>\r\n\t<li>Subsidised corporate team sports, running events and pedometer challenge</li>\r\n\t<li>Discounted gym memberships</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Career prospects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing the grad program, we will work with you to find a team that you wish to join permanently. In joining that team, you will be promoted to the role of Analyst. APRA promotes employees on capability growth, so your path and progression are your own, following the graduate program. &nbsp;You do not have to stay in a role level for a period of time before progression. APRA encourages open and honest discussions between the employee and their manager. We have numerous training courses to strengthen your skills, both personally and technically. APRA is focused on encouraging mobility; therefore you can move across teams as opportunities become available, or an opportunity to be seconded to another agency such as the RBA, ASIC, Treasury or the like.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<h3>About the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street full time. Over the&nbsp;course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within&nbsp;your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions, and group&nbsp;discussions — and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an intern, you are paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you&nbsp;on real-world projects we actually need done. When you’re not working on your project, you will&nbsp;have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources,&nbsp;attend guest speakers and social events, and engage with the parts of our work that excite you&nbsp;the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in&nbsp;the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a&nbsp;passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About the Position</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Linux Engineering intern, you’ll work side by side with full-timers to learn how we maintain&nbsp;and improve the critical infrastructure underlying our firm’s technology, including our production&nbsp;trading systems. On any given day, we might be debugging kernel performance, developing&nbsp;management tools, or resolving production issues in real time. Our mix of in-house and open&nbsp;source software allows us to investigate and innovate at every level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the program you’ll work on up to two projects, mentored closely by the full-time&nbsp;employees who designed them. Some projects consider big-picture questions that we’re still&nbsp;trying to figure out, while others involve building something new. Your mentors will be drawn&nbsp;from two different areas, so you’ll gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we&nbsp;solve every day — from finding new and interesting ways to resolve production issues quickly,&nbsp;perform comprehensive root-cause analyses, and integrate long-term fixes in a clean and robust&nbsp;way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll have a unique opportunity to see how our team interacts with almost every other group,&nbsp;building solutions that work on a firm-wide scale. We automate as much of our work as we can,&nbsp;because we find that automation reduces our error rate and overall workload — plus, we think it's fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About You</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We don’t expect you to have a background in one specific field — we’re looking for smart people&nbsp;who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than&nbsp;what you currently know. You should be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Knowledgeable of operating system fundamentals and computer architecture</li>\r\n\t<li>Able to understand network protocols at a basic level</li>\r\n\t<li>Someone who solves problems by writing code (in any language)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intellectually curious, collaborative, and eager to learn</li>\r\n\t<li>Humble and unafraid to ask questions and admit mistakes</li>\r\n\t<li>A strong communicator</li>\r\n\t<li>Are comfortable at the command-line of a *nix machine as you are in a GUI</li>\r\n\t<li>Experienced with systems programming concepts like C, sockets, virtual memory, and the process life cycle</li>\r\n\t<li>Experienced with a modern *nix system, whether that’s from course work, time spent as a systems administrator for your campus computer lab, side projects, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fluent in English</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note: Jane Street will provide flights to and from Hong Kong as well as accommodation throughout the entirety of the program.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Why choose Risk as a vacationer?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balancing risk and reward is a fine art. It’s not just about identifying risks, but also innovative solutions. It’s being compliant but also competitive. Vacationer roles in risk are an opportunity to help organisations plan for and tackle what’s around the next corner, and the one after that too. You could be digging into model data to predict event likelihood, identifying measures to keep vulnerable people safe, or investigating opportunities to maximise investments in governance technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose your pathway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways. With a range of disciplines and specialities, you can start in one place and go almost anywhere as you build your career here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply to this Business, Consulting &amp; Risk pathway and you’ll have the option to select the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and interests fit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location of this job:</strong> nominate your KPMG office location during the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is being a consultant?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company, a local charity, a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be forensic accountants working alongside a supply chain specialist and human rights experts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve. You might be researching and gathering information, like how have we helped another client with a similar challenge and how new technologies could help, updating project plans, as well as the delivery of the solution your client selects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore the types of work you could do in more detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the vacationer program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For students in their second-last year of study in 2025&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Applications close 14th April 2025</li>\r\n\t<li>Job offers made in May</li>\r\n\t<li>Real work from the start so you can make an impact and learn straightaway</li>\r\n\t<li>Start work approx. November with a job for 4-8 weeks to learn real-world work skills during your study vacation time</li>\r\n\t<li>Opportunities to move directly into our graduate program: a one-year program after you graduate with targeted coaching, support and development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What vacationers and grads say</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a safe environment learn, grow, and even try and fail under some great mentors in my team. We all look out for each other when there are difficult and new tasks. (Cici, 2021 grad)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it’s a client or other people around the office, I enjoy getting to know other people from all walks of life. (Tim, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m truly part of the team working on the project. My team support me to give things a try and learn as I work. (Matt, 2023 vacationer)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning about the workings of the world and having the tools and skills to develop viable solutions for all sorts of problems is why I love my job. (Kanwal, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's nice to be able to finish a job and sit back and be proud of the work we accomplished as a team. (Jessica, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Big things on offer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Coaching and feedback as standard</strong>: your own performance development manager and your broader team will help you build your skills with coaching and continuous feedback.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Focus on your interpersonal skills</strong>: you got the degree, now learn how to use it in a corporate career by applying your knowledge to real world problems and people.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>True commitment to wellbeing, diversity and community</strong>: we regularly track our progress on 21 public commitments we’ve made on governance, people, planet and prosperity in our Impact Plan, such as our gender pay gap, indigenous inclusion, mental health, learning and more</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Employee discounts</strong>: at 100s of stores (like JB HiFi, Woolworths, Airbnb and more) with our SmartSpend app</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Build your network, friendships and interests</strong>: clubs for a variety of interests from running to books, cooking, badminton, card games and so much more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About KPMG</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, we’re the Australian arm of a global network of professional firms providing a full range of services to organisations across a wide range of industries, government, and not-for-profit sectors.

Beside project valuation work, the Advisory team also works with governments and regulators on designing and evaluating energy policy. While most projects last for around four weeks, some longer projects, such as multi-client studies or longer pieces of policy work, can take a number of months. Graduate Analysts usually work alongside another Analysts, and project teams are made up of one or two Analysts, a Project Manager and a Senior Associate providing oversight. Teams re-form for each new project, so you will get the chance to work with everyone in the wider Advisory team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Research&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quarterly market forecast reports are the main output of the Research team.

Our managers carefully track teams' well-being to remain aware of how this balance stands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Community&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a warm and supportive office environment, and people at Aurora often organise activities together outside of work.

The goal of the role is that you will develop a positive, meaningful friendship with a socially isolated older person by visiting them on an ongoing basis (at least fortnightly). You’ll need patience, enthusiasm, a desire to develop friendships, compassion, and reliability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On your visits, the idea is that you share an activity that you both enjoy, based on mutual interests and mobility levels. You might share a cuppa and a chat, for example, or play board games, take a short walk in the garden, look at photos, reminisce, read the paper, listen to music...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a meaningful friendship will have a mutually positive impact on you both. You’ll gain a sense of purpose and deeper connection with your community, and your regular visits can improve the quality of life of an older person, by helping them feel less isolated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We need volunteer visitors who are based in the following areas:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Central West: </strong>Bathurst, Bowenfels, Gorman’s Hill, Kelso, Lithgow, Oberon, Singleton &amp; Singleton Heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nepean: </strong>Emu Plains, Freeman’s Reach, Jamisontown, Kingswood, Penrith, Richmond, St Mary’s, Werrington &amp; Windsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Orana Far West:</strong> Dubbo, Mudgee and Wellington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As a volunteer visitor, you will:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be reimbursed for travel mileage.</li>\r\n\t<li>Need to visit at least fortnightly (but ideally once a week).</li>\r\n\t<li>Undergo a National Police Check and reference checks.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Receive dedicated, ongoing support and training from the Digital Literacy Foundation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have had three Covid vaccinations.</li>\r\n</ul>",

    "description": "<p><strong>What it does:&nbsp;</strong>Regulates the financial services industry<br />\r\n<strong>Staff stats:&nbsp;</strong>Around 820<br />\r\n<strong>The good bits:</strong> A job like no other -<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Unique,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Interesting work. Ability to meet top executives across the industry. A role where you can give back, and have a positive impact on the Australian financial system. A rotational program where you can influence your journey. Develop yourself both technically and personally, in a culture that cares.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>The not-so-good bits:&nbsp;</strong>We need to be mindful of being Government, and reputational risk, so there are a number of meetings before we finalise our work. Potentially not as many ‘perks' as private sector roles.<br />\r\n<strong>Hiring grads with degrees in:&nbsp;</strong> Commerce, Actuarial, Engineering, Mathematics, STEM, IT &amp; Computer Sciences;&nbsp;Finance, Accounting, Economics &amp; Business Administration;&nbsp;Humanities, Arts &amp; Social Sciences;&nbsp;Law &amp; Legal Studies&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The APRA Graduate Program is one of the most in-depth and diverse in the financial services industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Graduate Program runs for 15 months. During this time you will complete three five-month rotations across a number of our teams including frontline supervision, risk, policy and advice, or data analytics. This program gives you the opportunity to build the core foundations of prudential regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside these rotations, you will be supported by an in-depth learning and development program, including access to an extensive range of in-house training programs. These are designed to support you in growing your technical and personal capabilities and help jump-start your career as a financial professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional development is ongoing throughout your career with us. In fact, professional development is an integral part of ensuring we maintain our excellence as a regulator. As one of our graduates, you’ll benefit from:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Being assigned a buddy - who is a graduate from the year before, and is fresh with understanding the challenges of being a graduate at APRA.</li>\r\n\t<li>Support from&nbsp;a number of managers – who manage you on each of your rotations, as well as a manager to support you&nbsp;for the duration of the Graduate Program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Working as part of an APRA team from the start.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of your Graduate Program, you will remain an employee of APRA and have the opportunity to drive your career in any of APRA's core functions, including specialist areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduate placements will be available in our Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch a series of videos featuring past graduates who share their experience being involved in the APRA Graduate Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Australian Prudential Regulation story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the privatisation and deregulation binge of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Federal Government established the Financial System Inquiry in 1996. It was tasked with proposing a regulatory system that would ensure an “efficient, responsive, competitive and flexible financial system to underpin stronger economic performance, consistent with financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness”. (Previously Australia’s financial services industry was regulated by the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Reserve Bank.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Financial System Inquiry recommended a statutory authority of the Federal Government be set up to oversee banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies, insurance companies and the superannuation industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 1 1998, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (commonly referred to as APRA) was established to do exactly this. Ever since, it has supervised institutions holding assets for Australian bank customers, insurance policyholders and super fund members. With considerable success across two decades, APRA has ensured those entities that make up the financial services industry remain financially sound and able to meet their obligations to their clients. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our vision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to reflect APRA's forward-looking philosophy, our Vision is focused on two strategic themes: Protected today and prepared for tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our values</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our values&nbsp;underpin the critical role we play in protecting the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our values were selected to help everyone at APRA to achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. In our work and in our interactions with others, we seek to demonstrate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;– we act without bias, are balanced in the use of our powers, and deliver on our commitments.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>&nbsp;– we actively seek out and encourage diverse points of view, to produce well-founded decisions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Accountability</strong>&nbsp;– we are open to challenge and scrutiny, and take responsibility for our actions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Respect</strong>&nbsp;– we are always respectful of others, and their opinions and ideas</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Excellence</strong>&nbsp;– we maintain high standards of quality and professionalism in all that we do</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Working and acting in these ways helps us achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our supervisory approach is forward-looking, primarily risk-based, consultative, consistent and in line with international best practices. This approach also recognises that management and boards of supervised institutions are primarily responsible for financial soundness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The culture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s workplace diversity strategy “takes a pro-active and innovative approach in creating a flexible and inclusive employment environment that values and utilises the contribution of people of different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and abilities”.&nbsp;APRA offers an extensive range of flexible work arrangements to allow staff to meet family and other commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social contribution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA staff play a vital role in protecting the financial well-being of almost every Australian citizen by overseeing around $8 trillion of bank deposits, super contributions and insurance premiums. APRA also has a workplace-giving scheme that allows donations to be taken directly from an employee’s salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The vibe of the place</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA combines most of the good aspects of the public and private sectors. Staff are well looked after but also get to enjoy a good work-life balance and an enviable degree of job security. While a clear hierarchy exists, those at the top of it are approachable. There are lots of social events and staff often go out for social occasions at the end of the working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The recruitment process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA recruits graduates who’ve achieved at least a minimum credit average in, but not limited to a discipline. Graduates from the following degrees are generally attracted to apply: actuarial studies, commerce, economics, econometrics, finance, financial modelling, law, mathematics, Engineering, public policy and statistics. Those from other disciplines may be considered if they are high achievers with impressive research and analytical skills. The grad program will be only available at APRA’s Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications open: February - April Annually, and at times an additional recruitment round can be opened throughout the year. If you are interested to keep in contact, register your interest by clicking the pre-register button below</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Apply online (February - April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Psychometric assessment (April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Assessment Centre (3 hours) (May)</li>\r\n\t<li>Final interview (In person in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or virtually) (June)</li>\r\n\t<li>Reference check (June -July)</li>\r\n\t<li>Offer or Merit List (July onwards)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year we often see many fabulous graduates, more than we can offer. In this instance, we inform some applicants that they are on a ‘Merit’ list. APRA uses this list should APRA increase the graduate program intake number or a graduate withdraws from the program. We also look to the Merit list before opening up a new recruitment campaign and we will keep you updated for the next 6 months regarding graduate-level opportunities across APRA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remuneration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s funding is provided by the industry it regulates rather than the taxpayer, and it offers unusually lavish benefits for a public-sector employer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA's graduate starting salary is $85,000 inclusive of superannuation. APRA is focused on intensively building your capabilities, and through capability growth, on average, graduate salaries have increased 10% annually for the first few years of your career. APRA is dedicated to investing in early talent and reviews salaries comparatively with external and internal salary data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy a range of benefits including working in a flexible, inclusive and diverse environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some benefits offered to employees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Health and well-being checks</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual flu vaccinations</li>\r\n\t<li>Employee Assistance Program (professional and confidential counselling sessions for employees and their immediate families)</li>\r\n\t<li>Wellbeing Ambassador network</li>\r\n\t<li>Ergonomic workstations</li>\r\n\t<li>Regular social events</li>\r\n\t<li>Subsidised corporate team sports, running events and pedometer challenge</li>\r\n\t<li>Discounted gym memberships</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Career prospects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing the grad program, we will work with you to find a team that you wish to join permanently. In joining that team, you will be promoted to the role of Analyst. APRA promotes employees on capability growth, so your path and progression are your own, following the graduate program. &nbsp;You do not have to stay in a role level for a period of time before progression. APRA encourages open and honest discussions between the employee and their manager. We have numerous training courses to strengthen your skills, both personally and technically. APRA is focused on encouraging mobility; therefore you can move across teams as opportunities become available, or an opportunity to be seconded to another agency such as the RBA, ASIC, Treasury or the like.&nbsp;</p>",

That’s where you come in. Maintain the world’s confidence in capital markets and drive innovation. Just accounting and finance? It’s trust in numbers, clear in the complex and new ways in solid systems. That’s creating a better world and an exciting career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose your pathway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways. With a range of disciplines and specialties, you can start in one place and go almost anywhere as you build your career here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply to this Audit, Assurance, and Finance pathway and you’ll have the option to select the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and interests fit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location of this job:</strong> nominate your KPMG office location during the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is being a consultant?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company, a local charity, or a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be forensic accountants working alongside an environmental specialist and change and communications professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work itself is varied depending on your team and the client, so expect to build knowledge of several industries and businesses. You might be researching and gathering information, critically assessing financial statements to understand if the information is correct, liaising with clients to understand decisions or challenges they face, working with your team to develop an audit opinion, or implement new compliance software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the vacationer program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For students in their second-last year of study in 2025</li>\r\n\t<li>Applications close 14th April 2025</li>\r\n\t<li>Job offers made in May</li>\r\n\t<li>Real work from the start so you can make an impact and learn straightaway</li>\r\n\t<li>Start work approx.

(Tim, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a safe environment learn, grow, and even try and fail under some great mentors in my team. We all look out for each other when there are difficult and new tasks. (Cici, 2021 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning about the workings of the world and having the tools and skills to develop viable solutions for all sorts of problems is why I love my job.

    "description": "<h3>About the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street full time. Over the course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions, and group discussions — and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an intern, you are paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you on real-world projects we actually need done. When you’re not working on your project, you will have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and engage with the parts of our work that excite you the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About the Position</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Strategy and Product Intern*, you’ll learn how we solve problems across departments to&nbsp;support the firm’s growth in an incredibly competitive global market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Strategy and Product department sits at the intersection of several teams, including&nbsp;Trading, Technology, Compliance, Finance, Operations, and more. With this unique, holistic&nbsp;perspective, interns are able to see how all parts of the firm interact and intersect with each&nbsp;other, getting a comprehensive overview of our business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the program, you'll work on live projects that combine big-picture thinking with deep&nbsp;dives into data and documentation. You might help identify and resolve bottlenecks, automate&nbsp;existing manual processes, or integrate new trade flows into our operational, regulatory, and&nbsp;technical infrastructure. In the process, you will coordinate closely with several internal&nbsp;stakeholders and groups to gather information and feedback. SP Interns returning full-time will&nbsp;spend their first year of employment engaged in a training curriculum called the Rotational Development Program&nbsp;- more info here:https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/sp-rdp/</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>*This role was previously categorized under the \"Business Development and Rotational Development Program\" department. We recently rebranded the name of the department to “Strategy and Product” to more accurately describe the work individuals on this team will contribute to.

We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Planning to graduate in 2026</li>\r\n\t<li>Interested in developing a broad range of technical skills, from working with and analyzing data to understanding and writing code</li>\r\n\t<li>Able to evaluate processes and create informed, concrete proposals (which you’ll proactively lead from start to finish)</li>\r\n\t<li>Reliable and courteous, with strong organizational, interpersonal, and communication skills</li>\r\n\t<li>Eager to ask questions, admit mistakes, and constantly deepen your understanding</li>\r\n\t<li>Has analytical experience using systematic problem solving (ie: through STEM coursework, previous work experience, extracurricular activities, etc.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Fluency in English required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note: Jane Street will provide flights to and from Hong Kong as well as accommodation throughout the entirety of the program.&nbsp;</p>",

And we're known for coming up with bold new ways to help clients solve their most complex commercial problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe help clients throughout their lifecycle. We help them grow and maximise value. We help protect them against financial loss and reputational damage. And we help them recover value in tough times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt KordaMentha, we provide the opportunity to work on interesting and varied engagements, where no two days are the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy joining us a vacationer, you will become part of a unique, creative and entrepreneurial team that works together to solve complex business problems. You will be given the opportunity to engage in a supportive environment where you're encouraged to ask \"what if?\" and \"why not?\" to find new ways to help clients grow, protect and recover value. Best of all, you'll learn from a diverse group of people while we invest in your study and training. You may only be here for a short time, but you will get exposure to a wide variety of tasks and by the end of the placement, you'll have a really good understanding of the industry and whether this is something you'd like to do as a graduate career!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApplying 'a different mindset' is at the heart of everything KordaMentha does, and it is fuelled by the diversity of our peoples' experiences and backgrounds. We are committed to enhancing diversity within the firm and celebrating differences.

We are one of the largest teams of forensic investigators, forensic accountants and forensic technology specialists in Asia-Pacific and are regularly called on to provide evidence in sensitive, high-profile disputes and investigations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur forensic technology group helps to identify, preserve, analyse and present electronic evidence to assist in investigations and disputes. Whether it be imaging personal computers, servers or mobile phones, or perhaps investigating a cyber hack, we quickly identify the facts. Our work often involves explaining difficult and complex concepts to our clients, often in a report or presentation, so we are looking for applicants with great written skills as well as a keen interest in technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What you'll be doing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a vacationer in our forensic technology group, you'll work as part of a diverse team and will learn the specialist skills and methodologies to become an expert in digital forensic and forensic discovery. While no two days will be the same, you can expect to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>work in a high tech forensic laboratory using cutting-edge equipment</li>\r\n\t<li>conduct forensic imaging of computers and other electronic devices (e.g. flash media, smartphones) to find and secure evidence</li>\r\n\t<li>conduct digital aspects of investigations alongside our expert investigators</li>\r\n\t<li>research new opportunities and assist with the preparation of proposals</li>\r\n\t<li>attend training courses to keep up to date with industry-leading software</li>\r\n\t<li>attend events and other marketing activities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>But it's not all about work. You'll be given a buddy to help you navigate office life as you settle in. We have regular catch-ups with People and Culture to ensure you are getting the most out of your placement. We host regular events and activities, bringing together our close-knit team in a friendly and relaxed environment so you can get to know the people behind the professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be a student in your penultimate year of study and will have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>an IT, computer science or law degree with strong academic results.</li>\r\n\t<li>excellent analytical and technical skills, with an ability to think outside the box.</li>\r\n\t<li>strong written skills.</li>\r\n\t<li>great communication skills and enjoy working in a team.</li>\r\n\t<li>eligibility to live and work in Australia (Australian citizens and permanent residents only).</li>\r\n</ul>",

The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) implements the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which is one of the biggest social reforms in the country since Medicare. As an Agency, we support more than 646,000 participants with a significant and permanent disability, and the families and carers of those living with disability. For many Australians, this will be the first time they receive the disability support they need.

A reputation is damaged. A new policy hasn’t met its objectives. The HR department hasn’t kept up with rapid business expansion. There are so many challenges in the everyday and in planning for the future – as a consultant, you’ll help solve problems like these within a cross-functional team who can truly assess a problem and then develop and deliver solutions that meet the client’s long-term goals. Taking this opportunity won’t just build your skills in the specialisation you choose, you’ll learn about a variety of fields and industries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose your pathway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways.

That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be finance experts working alongside software developers and change and communications professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve. You might be researching and gathering information, like how have we helped another client with a similar challenge and how new technologies could help, meeting with clients to understand their business, updating project plans, as well as the delivery of the solution your client selects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore the types of work you could do in more detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the vacationer program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For students in their second-last year of study in 2025</li>\r\n\t<li>Real work from the start so you can make an impact and learn straightaway</li>\r\n\t<li>Start work approx.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Australian Prudential Regulation story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the privatisation and deregulation binge of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Federal Government established the Financial System Inquiry in 1996. It was tasked with proposing a regulatory system that would ensure an “efficient, responsive, competitive and flexible financial system to underpin stronger economic performance, consistent with financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness”. (Previously Australia’s financial services industry was regulated by the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Reserve Bank.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Financial System Inquiry recommended a statutory authority of the Federal Government be set up to oversee banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies, insurance companies and the superannuation industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 1 1998, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (commonly referred to as APRA) was established to do exactly this. Ever since, it has supervised institutions holding assets for Australian bank customers, insurance policyholders and super fund members. With considerable success across two decades, APRA has ensured those entities that make up the financial services industry remain financially sound and able to meet their obligations to their clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our vision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to reflect APRA's forward-looking philosophy, our Vision is focused on two strategic themes: Protected today, prepared for tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our values</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our values&nbsp;underpin the critical role we play in protecting the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our values were selected to help everyone at APRA to achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. In our work and in our interactions with others, we seek to demonstrate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;– we act without bias, are balanced in the use of our powers, and deliver on our commitments.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>&nbsp;– we actively seek out and encourage diverse points of view, to produce well-founded decisions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Accountability</strong>&nbsp;– we are open to challenge and scrutiny, and take responsibility for our actions</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Respect</strong>&nbsp;– we are always respectful of others, and their opinions and ideas</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Excellence</strong>&nbsp;– we maintain high standards of quality and professionalism in all that we do</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Working and acting in these ways helps us achieve the high standards necessary for us to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. Our supervisory approach is forward-looking, primarily risk-based, consultative, consistent and in line with international best practice. This approach also recognises that management and boards of supervised institutions are primarily responsible for financial soundness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The culture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s workplace diversity strategy “takes a pro-active and innovative approach in creating a flexible and inclusive employment environment that values and utilises the contribution of people of different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and abilities”.&nbsp;APRA offers an extensive range of flexible work arrangements to allow staff to meet family and other commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social contribution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA staff play a vital role in protecting the financial well-being of almost every Australian citizen by overseeing around $8 trillion of bank deposits, super contributions and insurance premiums. APRA also has a workplace-giving scheme that allows donations to be taken directly from an employee’s salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The vibe of the place</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA combines most of the good aspects of the public and private sectors. Staff are well looked after but also get to enjoy a good work-life balance and enviable degree of job security. While a clear hierarchy exists, those at the top of it are approachable. There are lots of social events and staff often go out for social occasions at the end of the working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The recruitment process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA recruits graduates who’ve achieved at least a minimum credit average in, but not limited to a discipline. Graduates from the following degrees are generally attracted to apply: actuarial studies, commerce, economics, econometrics, finance, financial modelling, law, mathematics, Engineering, public policy and statistics. Those from other disciplines may be considered if they are high achievers with impressive research and analytical skills. The grad program will be only available at APRA’s Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications open: February - April Annually, and at times an additional recruitment round can be opened throughout the year. If you are interested to keep in contact, register your interest by clicking the pre-register button below</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Apply online (February- April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Psychometric assessment (April)</li>\r\n\t<li>Assessment Centre (3 hours) (May)</li>\r\n\t<li>Final interview (In person at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or virtually) (June)</li>\r\n\t<li>Reference check (June -July)</li>\r\n\t<li>Offer or Merit List (July onwards)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year we often see many fabulous graduates, more than we can offer. In this instance we inform some applicants that they are on a ‘Merit’ list. APRA uses this list should APRA increase the graduate program intake number or a graduate withdraws from the program. We also look to the Merit list before opening up a new recruitment campaign and we will keep you updated for the next 6 months regarding graduate-level opportunities across APRA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remuneration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA’s funding is provided by the industry it regulates rather than the taxpayer, and it offers unusually lavish benefits for a public-sector employer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APRA's graduate starting salary is $85,000 inclusive of superannuation. APRA is focused on intensively building your capabilities, and through capability growth, on average, graduate salaries have increased 10% annually for the first few years or your career. APRA is dedicated to investing in early talent and reviews salaries comparatively with external and internal salary data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy a range of benefits including working in a flexible, inclusive and diverse environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some benefits offered to employees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Health and well-being checks</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual flu vaccinations</li>\r\n\t<li>Employee Assistance Program (professional and confidential counselling sessions for employees and their immediate families)</li>\r\n\t<li>Wellbeing Ambassador network</li>\r\n\t<li>Ergonomic workstations</li>\r\n\t<li>Regular social events</li>\r\n\t<li>Subsidised corporate team sports, running events and pedometer challenge</li>\r\n\t<li>Discounted gym memberships</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Career prospects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing the grad program, we will work with you to find a team that you wish to join permanently. In joining that team, you will be promoted to the role of Analyst. APRA promotes employees on capability growth, so your path and progression is your own, following the graduate program. &nbsp;You do not have to stay in a role level for a period of time before progression. APRA encourages open and honest discussions between the employee and their manager. We have numerous training courses to strengthen your skills, both personally and technically. APRA is focused on encouraging mobility; therefore you can move across teams as opportunities become available, or an opportunity to be seconded to another agency such as the RBA, ASIC, Treasury or the like.&nbsp;</p>",

With a range of disciplines and specialties, you can start in one place and go almost anywhere as you build your career here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply to this Business, Consulting, and Risk pathway and you’ll have the option to select the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and interests fit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location of this job:</strong> nominate your KPMG office location during the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is being a consultant?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company, a local charity, or a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be finance experts working alongside software developers and change and communications professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve. You might be researching and gathering information, like how have we helped another client with a similar challenge and how new technologies could help, meeting with clients to understand their business, updating project plans, as well as the delivery of the solution your client selects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the graduate program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For students in their final year of study in 2025 or who recently graduated and are not yet in professional work</li>\r\n\t<li>A one-year grow pathway with targeted coaching, support, and development as you grow your new career</li>\r\n\t<li>Real work from the start so you can make an impact and learn straightaway</li>\r\n\t<li>Start work in February 2025 (typically, some teams have a slightly different schedule) with a full-time and ongoing graduate role.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What grads say</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it’s a client or other people around the office, I enjoy getting to know other people from all walks of life.

    "description": "<p>Our candidate pool will be reviewed as additional places in our Graduate Program come up, so please apply to still be in with a chance to start something big with us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why choose Risk as a grad?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balancing risk and reward is a fine art. It’s not just about identifying risks, but also innovative solutions. It’s being compliant but also competitive. Graduate roles in risk are an opportunity to help organisations plan for and tackle what’s around the next corner, and the one after that too. You could be digging into model data to predict event likelihood, identifying measures to keep vulnerable people safe, or investigating opportunities to maximise investments in governance technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose your pathway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways. With a range of disciplines and specialties, you can start in one place and go almost anywhere as you build your career here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply to this Business, Consulting, and Risk pathway and you’ll have the option to select the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and interests fit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location of this job:</strong> nominate your KPMG office location during the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is being a consultant?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company, a local charity, or a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be forensic accountants working alongside a supply chain specialist and human rights experts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve. You might be researching and gathering information, like how have we helped another client with a similar challenge and how new technologies could help, updating project plans, as well as the delivery of the solution your client selects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the graduate program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For students in their final year of study in 2025 or who recently graduated and are not yet in professional work</li>\r\n\t<li>A one-year grow pathway with targeted coaching, support, and development as you grow your new career</li>\r\n\t<li>Real work from the start so you can make an impact and learn straightaway</li>\r\n\t<li>Start work in February 2026 (typically, some teams have a slightly different schedule) with a full-time and ongoing graduate role.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What grads say</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it’s a client or other people around the office, I enjoy getting to know other people from all walks of life. (Tim, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a safe environment to learn, grow, and even try and fail under some great mentors in my team. We all look out for each other when there are difficult and new tasks. (Cici, 2021 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning about the workings of the world and having the tools and skills to develop viable solutions for all sorts of problems is why I love my job. (Kanwal, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's nice to be able to finish a job and sit back and be proud of the work we accomplished as a team. (Jessica, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I already get to work directly with company CFOs and management to help with accounting practices. (Andrew, 2023 grad)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Big things on offer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Coaching and feedback as standard</strong>: your own performance development manager and your broader team will help you build your skills with coaching and continuous feedback.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Focus on your interpersonal skills</strong>: you got the degree, now learn how to use it in a corporate career by applying your knowledge to real-world problems and people.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>True commitment to wellbeing, diversity, and community</strong>: we regularly track our progress on 21 public commitments we’ve made on governance, people, planet, and prosperity in our Impact Plan, such as our gender pay gap, indigenous inclusion, mental health, learning, and more.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Employee discounts</strong>: at 100s of stores (like JB HiFi, Woolworths, Airbnb, and more) with our SmartSpend app</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Build your network, friendships, and interests</strong>: clubs for a variety of interests from running to books, cooking, badminton, card games and so much more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About KPMG</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, we’re the Australian arm of a global network of professional firms providing a full range of services to organisations across a wide range of industries, government, and not-for-profit sectors.
